# Retail_Data_Analysis
In this project, we've built a data pipeline that focuses on the Order Intelligence.  As part of which we've have been tasked with computing various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an e-commerce company, RetailCorp Inc.
Broadly, we have performed the following tasks in this project:
- Reading the sales data from the Kafka server
- Preprocessing the data to calculate additional derived columns such as total_cost etc
- Calculating the time-based KPIs and time and country-based KPIs
- Storing the KPIs (both time-based and time- and country-based) for a 10-minute interval into separate JSON files for further analysis
